# Artificial-Limbs-IH2Azzurra --> Handy
Development of a high level controller for the IH2 Azzurra (SSSA) robotic hand using a PIC18F4431 microcontroller and XC8 compiler (Microchip).

The project was developed together with my fantastic colleagues HÃ¼seyin Eken and Edgar Daniel Fonseca Rojas.

## Additional details
Intrinsic robotic hand having all functional components (5 motors, force sensors and control electronics) integrated in the palm and sub-actuated fingers. The high number of independent axes and several integrated force sensors allow it to perform different types of gripping and to sense when an object is being grasped. 

It is equipped with an easy-to-use communication interface (RS-232 via USB or Bluetooth). Various standard mechanical interfaces are available on request (also compatible with Ottobock QWD wrist). The small size of IH2 Azzurra allows it to be used in research and clinical settings with amputees, during activities of daily living. Ideal for validating human-machine interfaces (invasive and non-invasive), control algorithms (EMG, ENG, EEG, etc.) and sensory feedback systems. Thanks to the low weight and the high degree of anthropomorphism, they are also perfect as end-effectors for collaborative robotic arms with limited payload.
